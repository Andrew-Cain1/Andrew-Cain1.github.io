              <p>Paquita Sabrafen was born in Barcelona in 1931. In 1936 at the time of the Spanish Civil War her father, Alfredo Sabrafen, was a Republican and also a philanthropist who helped support Artists exiled by the Franco Regime, like Picasso. He was a patron of the arts and provided his daughter with an environment in which artistic pursuits were a part of life.</p>

              </div>
              <br>
              <p>Sabrafen also has many significant paintings in religious institutions in Spain including: in the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Orito in Alicante; in the Founding Convent of the Salesian, Alicante; in the Church and Convent of the Carmelitas in the town of Lietor, Castilla La Mancha; and in the Cotolengo de Padre Alegre in Barcelona. Sabrafen's paintings can also be found in private and public collections around the world.</p>
              <br>
              <p>After experiencing the loss of a mother, a Civil War and a World War her father moved his family to the Americas - Buenos Aires, Argentina. At the time Buenos Aires was a place of prosperity and culture as Europeans moved their wealth there to escape the wars. There her teachers recognised a talent in the child for the art of painting.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Sabrafen studied under and was influenced by several artists from that time onwards. Andrea Morch (born 1866,) who was part of the impressionist movement in Argentina, was her first dedicated tutor from 1944. Vincent Puig (former pupil of Spanish Artist Moises) taught portraiture, drawing and painting in oils.  She studied murals and landscapes with F. Guinart, learnt about painting human anatomy and marine scenery with Reverend Huget, and considered different animal figures with Viladrich, as well as learning from and working with other masters. Many became her friends and considered her the young promise of their group.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Paquita Sabrafen returned to Spain in 1963 to paint commissioned portraits, to exhibit and to reunite with family. In Barcelona in December, 1963, Paquita Sabrafen had examinations approved and was qualified as a "Maestro" in the field of Artistic Painting by the Principal Guild of Master painters and Sculptures of the City of Barcelona.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Sabrafen has received official honours in a number of countries, both for her art and her other qualities. She maintained her vocation with unstinting energy until her death in January, 2009, thanks to her talent and her love of life which enabled her to show in her works the aspects of human endeavour. By the end of her life she had travelled extensively throughout the world but mainly had divided her time between Australia and Spain.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Paquita Sabrafen dedicated a lifetime to her work and was a master in her profession. Her work and the fruits they bear are permanent.</p>

                        In the Renon Gallery, an exhibition of oil paintings of the prestigious painter Paquita Sabrafen Puig was inaugurated. An artist proceeded by much deserved distinction that has echoed all over, made itself known to all the critics of the country.
                        <br>
                        Amongst the portraits exhibited some have featured well known personalities of our city.

                        <br>
                        On her visit she has made many interesting comments concerning the importance of the portrait as a never ending expression of the painter.

                        The difficult art of portrait painting is enriched by the excellent work of Paquita Sabrafen Puig as seen in her new exhibition at the Renon Gallery. Her feminine touch prevails throughout all her paintings with an exquisite good taste which reflects the inner life of her models. This is most obvious in work 12 and 13 where the spontaneity of her fluid style can be appreciated.

                        <br>
                        Paquita Sabrafen was born in Barcelona and when just a young girl she went to Buenos Aires. There she studied Fine Arts and specialised in painting with masters such as Vicente Puig, Andrea Moch and Guinart. She discovered her vocation for the portrait and specialised in it, having realised various exhibitions. She is well known in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and countries of Spanish decent. Miss Sabrafen possesses a fine delicacy and at the same time a profound knowledge of colour. She paints the soul (heart) in her portraits. In our city her exhibitions will be held.

  The beautiful artist has concepts and an amplitude of “miras” that shine from within her black eyelashes, put this together with the melody in her words and there you have defined the artist Catalan – Argentine.

                        <br>
                        The self portrait is not a caprice- it is a determined frame of mind – a pictorial work of art is a result of placing oneself with the exterior.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Paquita Sabrafen is a young and beautiful Catalan painter who has been a resident of Argentina for 20 years. Five months ago she returned to the country of her origin, to get to know it well. She has travelled through most of Spain and has lived in Barcelona, where she plans to return after her visit to Paris and Rome.

                        P.S: What surprised me the most was the changing colour of the sea in different places. Also, eyes change colour depending on the light of each place......

                        PS: Trying to transmit one’s inner feelings, the artist, does this at times with pleasure and at other times with suffering. In the most inspired moments pain is quite possible, due to the very tension that keeps one glued to the subject. A pictorial work of art is the result of being able to place oneself with the exterior and the tensions experienced may be quite diverse.

                        <br>
                        PS: When I paint a self portrait I look at myself with an air of defiance, trying to discover my own heart/ soul. The self portrait is not done out of caprice, it responds to a state of determined soul. There are times that for ‘animicos’ shocks, it is necessary to exteriorize oneself. It is possible that if I were to paint various self portraits each would be different, because it would be a response to distinct ‘animicos’ states.

                        PS: I try to reflect a medium level of the animico within the general social atmosphere of each person. It is true that while painting the portrait of the wife of the Consulate General, that has been evident.
