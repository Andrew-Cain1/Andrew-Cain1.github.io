              Paquita had a tumultuous childhood, beginning with the death of her mother at age 5 and moving from her home in Barcelona to France due to the Spanish Civil War. Then having to move again due to the Second World War to Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is here that she began her journey in art, taking lessons from famed artist Andrea Morch who was part of the impressionist movement in Argentina. She also studied under and was influenced by many other artists. Vincent Puig (former pupil of Spanish Artist Moises) taught her portraiture, drawing and painting in oils.  She studied murals and landscapes with F. Guinart, learnt about painting human anatomy and marine scenery with Reverend Huget, and considered different animal figures with Viladrich as well as learning from and working with other masters. Many became her friends and considered her the young promise of their group.

Since then she exhibited on various occasions at &lsquo;GaleriaMuller&rsquo;, in the Alvear Palace in Buenos Aires, and the&lsquo;Galeria Renon&rsquo; in Rosario. She became the preferred portrait painter of distinguished society in Buenos Aires.
