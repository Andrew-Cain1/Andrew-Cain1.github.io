              Paquita had a tumultuous childhood, beginning with the death of her mother at age 5 and moving from her home in Barcelona to France due to the Spanish Civil War. Then having to move again due to the Second World War to Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is here that she began her journey in art, taking lessons from famed artist Andrea Morch who was part of the impressionist movement in Argentina. She also studied under and was influenced by many other artists. Vincent Puig (former pupil of Spanish Artist Moises) taught her portraiture, drawing and painting in oils.  She studied murals and landscapes with F. Guinart, learnt about painting human anatomy and marine scenery with Reverend Huget, and considered different animal figures with Viladrich as well as learning from and working with other masters. Many became her friends and considered her the young promise of their group.
              <br>
              <br>
              In 1950 the first solo exhibitions of her oils were held in Argentina. Since then she exhibited on various occasions at &lsquo;GaleriaMuller&rsquo;, in the Alvear Palace in Buenos Aires, and the&lsquo;Galeria Renon&rsquo; in Rosario. She became the preferred portrait painter of distinguished society in Buenos Aires.
              <br>
              <br>
              She has combined portrait and figure painting with landscapes and still life, and is a master in her profession. Among her latest works are the painting titled &ldquo;Torn by War&rdquo; &ndash; Eric Campbell, ABC Foreign Correspondent. This painting expresses his personal tragedy, the loss of his cameraman, Paul Moran who was the first Australian to die in the Iraq War. It is a historic painting marking the beginning of the war in Iraq with global significance.
              <br>
              <br>
              Another more recent work is the portrait of Masako Ide, who in October 2004, was personally awarded a medal from the Emperor of Japan for her service to her country in the area of public health. The painting was completed March, 2005. These are historic paintings recording important incidents. She has also painted members of the Fijian Royal Family and noted politicians.
              <br>
              <br>
              In June, 2005, Paquita Sabrafen was warmly received by the Deputy Director of the China National Art Museum, Mr Shulin Ma and by other senior curators and officials. They showed appreciation for the Artisit's work.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sabrafen has received official honours in a number of countries, both for her art and her other qualities. She maintained her vocation with unstinting energy, thanks to her talent and her love of life which enabled her to show in her works the aspects of human endeavour.
              <br>
              <br>
 	            By the end of he life she had travelled extensively throughout the world and had settled down to compose many of her works in an atmosphere of peace and healthy abundance in a small pueblo in La Mancha, Spain. A pueblo in which she lived with her husband <a href="target8.html">Joaquin</a>  in an historic 300 year old mansion, which she had restored for her work and comfort. The Villa &ndash; Studio being situated on a mountain side, looking out over other mountains and a river flowing beneath.
              <br>
              <br>
              Paquita Sabrafen dedicated a lifetime to her work and was a master in her profession. Her work and the fruits they bear are permanent.

                      The difficult art of portrait painting is enriched by the excellent work of Paquita Sabrafen Puig as seen in her new exhibition at the Renon Gallery. Her feminine touch prevails throughout all her paintings with an exquisite good taste which reflects the inner life of her models. This is most obvious in work 12 and 13 where the spontaneity of her fluid style can be appreciated.
