              <font size="+3">I</font>nternationally renowned artist, <a href="target4.html">Paquita Sabrafen</a>,was born in 1931 in Barcelona, Spain. She has dedicated her life to her work and is a master in her profession. Having specialized in portraits, her brush strokes convey the spirit of her subject on to the canvas. A combination of control over her instruments and colours, with the powerfulness of a creative spirit, enables her to convey many sentiments and ideals in her paintings.
              <br>

              Paquita had a tumultuous childhood, beginning with the death of her mother at age 5 and moving from her home in Barcelona to France due to the Spanish Civil War. Then having to move again due to the Second World War to Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is here that she began her journey in art, taking lessons from famed artist Andrea Morch who was part of the impressionist movement in Argentina. She also studied under and was influenced by many other artists. Vincent Puig (former pupil of Spanish Artist Moises) taught her portraiture, drawing and painting in oils.  She studied murals and landscapes with F. Guinart, learnt about painting human anatomy and marine scenery with Reverend Huget, and considered different animal figures with Viladrich as well as learning from and working with other masters. Many became her friends and considered her the young promise of their group.
              <br>
              <br>
              In 1950 the first solo exhibitions of her oils were held in Argentina. Since then she exhibited on various occasions at &lsquo;GaleriaMuller&rsquo;, in the Alvear Palace in Buenos Aires, and the&lsquo;Galeria Renon&rsquo; in Rosario. She became the preferred portrait painter of distinguished society in Buenos Aires.
              <br>
              <br>
              She has combined portrait and figure painting with landscapes and still life, and is a master in her profession. Among her latest works are the painting titled &ldquo;Torn by War&rdquo; &ndash; Eric Campbell, ABC Foreign Correspondent. This painting expresses his personal tragedy, the loss of his cameraman, Paul Moran who was the first Australian to die in the Iraq War. It is a historic painting marking the beginning of the war in Iraq with global significance.
              <br>
              <br>
              Another more recent work is the portrait of Masako Ide, who in October 2004, was personally awarded a medal from the Emperor of Japan for her service to her country in the area of public health. The painting was completed March, 2005. These are historic paintings recording important incidents. She has also painted members of the Fijian Royal Family and noted politicians.
              <br>
              <br>
              In June, 2005, Paquita Sabrafen was warmly received by the Deputy Director of the China National Art Museum, Mr Shulin Ma and by other senior curators and officials. They showed appreciation for the Artisit's work.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sabrafen has received official honours in a number of countries, both for her art and her other qualities. She maintained her vocation with unstinting energy, thanks to her talent and her love of life which enabled her to show in her works the aspects of human endeavour.
              <br>
              <br>
 	            By the end of he life she had travelled extensively throughout the world and had settled down to compose many of her works in an atmosphere of peace and healthy abundance in a small pueblo in La Mancha, Spain. A pueblo in which she lived with her husband <a href="target8.html">Joaquin</a>  in an historic 300 year old mansion, which she had restored for her work and comfort. The Villa &ndash; Studio being situated on a mountain side, looking out over other mountains and a river flowing beneath.
              <br>
              <br>
              Paquita Sabrafen dedicated a lifetime to her work and was a master in her profession. Her work and the fruits they bear are permanent.

                        The difficult art of portrait painting is enriched by the excellent work of Paquita Sabrafen Puig as seen in her new exhibition at the Renon Gallery. Her feminine touch prevails throughout all her paintings with an exquisite good taste which reflects the inner life of her models. This is most obvious in work 12 and 13 where the spontaneity of her fluid style can be appreciated.

                        <br>
                        Paquita Sabrafen was born in Barcelona and when just a young girl she went to Buenos Aires. There she studied Fine Arts and specialised in painting with masters such as Vicente Puig, Andrea Moch and Guinart. She discovered her vocation for the portrait and specialised in it, having realised various exhibitions. She is well known in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and countries of Spanish decent. Miss Sabrafen possesses a fine delicacy and at the same time a profound knowledge of colour. She paints the soul (heart) in her portraits. In our city her exhibitions will be held.

  The beautiful artist has concepts and an amplitude of “miras” that shine from within her black eyelashes, put this together with the melody in her words and there you have defined the artist Catalan – Argentine.

                        <strong>Monday, Barcelona, 16th December, 1963. “Talking with Paquita Sabrafen”</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The self portrait is not a caprice- it is a determined frame of mind – a pictorial work of art is a result of placing oneself with the exterior.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Paquita Sabrafen is a young and beautiful Catalan painter who has been a resident of Argentina for 20 years. Five months ago she returned to the country of her origin, to get to know it well. She has travelled through most of Spain and has lived in Barcelona, where she plans to return after her visit to Paris and Rome.

                        It is in the residence of Doctor Martinez Fraile that we interview Paquita. The The library has transformed into a studio, and the painter is working on a painting. Angelica A de Araujo the wife of the Consul General of Argentina, also of Spanish decent.

                        <br>
                        L.P: Please tell me about your impression of the variety in the Spanish landscape.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        P.S: What surprised me the most was the changing colour of the sea in different places. Also, eyes change colour depending on the light of each place......

                        LP: When experimenting what gives you the greatest satisfaction, painting a portrait, an urban scene or a country landscape?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        PS: Trying to transmit one’s inner feelings, the artist, does this at times with pleasure and at other times with suffering. In the most inspired moments pain is quite possible, due to the very tension that keeps one glued to the subject. A pictorial work of art is the result of being able to place oneself with the exterior and the tensions experienced may be quite diverse.

                        <br>
                        LP: What do you experience when you paint yourself portrait?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        PS: When I paint a self portrait I look at myself with an air of defiance, trying to discover my own heart/ soul. The self portrait is not done out of caprice, it responds to a state of determined soul. There are times that for ‘animicos’ shocks, it is necessary to exteriorize oneself. It is possible that if I were to paint various self portraits each would be different, because it would be a response to distinct ‘animicos’ states.

                        <br>
                        LP: When you paint a portrait of others what are your thoughts?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        PS: I try to reflect a medium level of the animico within the general social atmosphere of each person. It is true that while painting the portrait of the wife of the Consulate General, that has been evident.
